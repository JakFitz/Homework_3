First I wrote the passwordOptions function, in order to create the prompts users could use to change how the password was generated and added it to the 
generatebtn.addeventlistener in order to have the prompts appear after clicking the button

then I created the variables to use in the functions, I also made a list of characters for use in the password generator

then I created the random number generator, this randomly select from the list of characters I created

then I created the makePassword function in order to string the randomly selected characters together

finally I added the document.queryselector to make the password appear on the page
